# SqliteEfTest
A sample WinForms application to show how to use Sqlite, EntityFramework and EntityFramework Migrations together.

It uses nothing but official Sqlite packages for .Net and EntityFramework and in order to enable database migrations, a package called
[System.Data.SQLite.EF6.Migrations](https://github.com/bubibubi/sqliteef6migrations) is used.
